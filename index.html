            emotional wellbeing, it’s time to get your pet approved as an
            Emotional Support Animal (ESA).</span>
          <p>Federal laws protect your rights. The Fair Housing Amendments Act (FHA)
            protects your rights to have an Emotional Support Animal (ESA) in any housing

            allows you to travel with you pet for free and bring them inside the terminal and
            to your seat. Even stores, restaurants and hotels are openly accommodating to
            well-behaved ESA approved pets. Click the button to take the quiz and qualify
